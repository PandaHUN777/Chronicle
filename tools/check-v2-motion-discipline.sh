# Enforces motion discipline in the V2-scope plugin directories: no NEW
# `transition: all` (raw CSS) or `transition-all` (Tailwind utility) in
# calendar / timeline / ai_workspace / campaigns plugin sources. Only
# `transform` and `opacity` may be transitioned there; other properties are
# discouraged by the same rule but harder to lint statically, so they're
# documented in the plugins' .ai.md and enforced via PR review instead.

# Diff-scoped FAIL: only checks lines INTRODUCED by the PR vs origin/main.
# Pre-existing violations are grandfathered.

# Forbidden tokens are reconstructed via fragment join so the script can scan
# its own directory tree without self-matching.

# Exit codes:
#   0 — no new violations introduced by the diff vs the merge base
#   1 — at least one new violation; CI fails
