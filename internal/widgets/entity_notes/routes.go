// RegisterRoutes mounts the entity_notes REST endpoints. All routes
// require campaign membership at minimum (RolePlayer); audience checks
// further restrict what each viewer can see/write inside the service.
//
// Reads (GET): RolePlayer — the audience filter handles per-row visibility.
// Writes (POST/PUT/DELETE): RolePlayer — the audience checks handle role
// gates per-write (e.g., players can author private/everyone/custom but
// not dm_only).
//
// Gated on the "player-notes" addon (ADR-056): a feature toggle, so off means
// off for every caller, with no first-party exception.
