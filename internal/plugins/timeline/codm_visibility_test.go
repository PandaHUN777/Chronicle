// co-DM must be promoted to cc.VisibilityRole() so they see dm_only events
// like an Owner, EXCEPT when view-as-player is active, which must still
// force RolePlayer regardless of promotion.

// This exercises effectiveRole directly (a pure function of the preview flag
// and CampaignContext); it proves role selection, not that every SQL/service
// path narrows content correctly for that role (see service.go / repository.go).
