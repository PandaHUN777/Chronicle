// dm_grant_dashboard_test.go pins ADR-057: the dashboard's "recently updated
// entities" list must be gated on cc.VisibilityRole(), not the raw
// cc.MemberRole, so a Co-DM (Player + DM grant) sees dm_only entities there
// the same as in the entities plugin's own list and category views.
//
// This drives the real Show handler up to the ListRecentForDashboard call
// and captures the role integer actually passed (recovering from any
// unrelated template panic so the capture still lands), rather than
// rendering the full dashboard page or stubbing VisibilityRole() itself.
